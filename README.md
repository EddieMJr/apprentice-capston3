# 🔒 LockBox  
**Your first step toward stronger password security**

LockBox is a web application designed to educate users about password safety and help them evaluate and improve the security of their own passwords. Our team built LockBox because many people still use weak, reused, or unsafe passwords across accounts — and we wanted to create a tool that makes learning security both easy and accessible.
